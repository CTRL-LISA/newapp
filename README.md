I'm Lisa, a former rabbit psychologist, now making a go as a coder. As a person, I'm "just okay." I'm allergic to rabbits. I'm going to make an app. I don't know what it will be, but I'm sure it will be great and more productive than helping hopeless rabbits.

My app will:

* Have stuff.

* Do stuff.

* Get me to pass this course.
